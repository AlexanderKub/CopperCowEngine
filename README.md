# Copper Cow Engine
C# 3D Engine that uses DirectX 11 and SharpDX.
Best engine for copper cows visualization 2019. (In my opinion).

Features:
1) Forward rendering (with lights issues, WIP).
2) Deffered rendering (with lights issues, WIP).
3) Forward+ aka Tiled Forward rendering.
4) Shadow maps (issues with different render paths).
5) PBR materials with Albedo, Roughness, Metallic, Normal and AO maps.
6) Assets manager WIP - all raw assets packs into custom binary assets files for improve engine loading performance.
7) UI Editor really early WIP.

Roadmap: 
1) Shadow maps stable work.
2) [Clustered forward](http://www.humus.name/Articles/PracticalClusteredShading.pdf) rendering and combine it with small G-Buffer [like DOOM does](http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2016/09/09/doom-2016-graphics-study/).
3) Shadow volumes.
4) Assets manager finish importer/editor for all types of asset.
5) UI editor for creating scenes.
6) Skinning and animations.
7) And so on and so forth.
